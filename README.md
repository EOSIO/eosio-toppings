# EOSIO Toppings

This is a monorepo composed of the various packages which work together to create a web-based development tool to help users create applications on the EOSIO blockchain. Users will be able to perform various actions related to smart contract and application development using this tool. 

## Package Index

* [Nodeos GUI Web UI](./packages/ui-gui-nodeos): React-based Web Application making use of all the services in this repo
* API Services:
    * [EOSIO Compiler / Deployment Service](./packages/api-eosio-compiler): Node.JS/Express API server for compiling and deploying smart contracts to a `nodeos` instance. Spins up a Docker container under the hood for contract compilation.
    * [MongoDB Plugin API](./packages/api-mongodb-plugin): TypeScript API service for interacting with the blockchain MongoDB (`nodeos` run with the MongoDB plugin)
    * [RPC API](./packages/api-rpc): TypeScript API service wrapper around the EOSIO RPC API
* Docker-based Services:
    * [EOSIO nodeos Docker Container](./packages/docker-eosio-nodeos): Dockerfile and build scripts for the Docker container running a local `nodeos` instance
    * [MongoDB Docker Container](./packages/docker-mongodb): Dockerfile and build scripts for the Docker container running a local MongoDB service

## Directory Layout

At present there are two main directories:

* **apps** - Utilities that may be useful for developers outside of the main functions and services
* **packages** - Contains the main services that comprise this monorepo

## Getting Started

A more detailed explanation on how to get started with the EOSIO Toppings tool can be found in the [help document](help.md).

To get quickly set up and running with this tool, please perform the following steps:
1. Directly clone this monorepo (using `git clone`)
2. Navigate to the root level of the cloned repository and run `./first_time_setup.sh` to install and build all the necessary dependencies
3. Run `./apps/gui-nodeos/quick_start.sh`, which will automatically start the tool in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` after creating the necessary containers and services

### Caveats (ports)

By default, the following ports need to be opened:

* `3000` (main tool in server mode)
* `5000` (main tool in production mode)
* `8081` (EOSIO compiler/deployment service)

However, you are free to change these at your leisure.
